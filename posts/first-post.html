<p>The plan is to go in to the <a href="cba.mit.edu">CBA</a> and successfully make something.
I used Rhino to sketch up a question mark "?", with the aim of cutting it out of glass using the waterjet.</p>

<p>Sam helped me export a DXF file and load it into OMax, the software used for
creating toolpaths for the waterjet. We had to manually adjust the lead-in cuts
so that they started off of the glass. Starting the cut directly on the glass
increases the chance that it will break because of the chaotic forces involved
in the water bouncing back off before the glass is fully pierced. Starting from
off of the glass is almost like starting on a pre-pierced section and cutting
inwards.</p>

<p>The cut went perfectly, which was surprising to me and to Sam. We were worried
that it would crack while being cut; to help prevent this, we mounted the glass
on some scrap plastic. This seemed to have done the trick because the cut came
out very smooth. There is a break in the lower left but it doesn't affect the
cut-out pieces. This would be an issue if we wanted to re-use the base glass
but we don't in this case.</p>

<p>I threw some adhesive on the back and mounted it on my door.</p>

<p>Success! Next step is to upgrade to more dimensions of machining, most likely
with some of the shopbot tools.</p></div>
